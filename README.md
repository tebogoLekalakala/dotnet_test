Project name:dotnet test

Description:
Application can draw elements using numbers provide in the text boxes. It can update as you input the numbers
and draw according to your updated numbers. All text boxes have validation on them, you cannot input non-numeric
characters inside the text boxes. It will not proceed until you input the right numbers.

Challenges:
Minor challenges on remembering the depth, width and height and drawing the 3D diagram. Reason why is that 
at my CTI college days I used to be the master of creating the c++ libraries which I could draw my name
in 3D with 2D points which I coded.

Remarks:
I thank you for a very fun project. I am hungry for more and learning more.
